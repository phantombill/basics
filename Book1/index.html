    <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>
    <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.</p>

    <h1>Scrambled Eggs</h1>
    <p>Eggs are one of my favourite foods. Here is a recipe for deliciously rich scrambled eggs.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>2 eggs</li>
     <li>1tbs butter</li>
     <li>2tbs cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>Melt butter in a frying pan over a medium heat</li>
     <li>Gently mix the eggs and cream in a bowl</li>
     <li>Once butter has melted add cream and eggs</li>
     <li>Using a spatula fold the eggs from the edge of the pan to the center every 20 seconds (as if you are making an omelette)</li>
     <li>When the eggs are still moist remove from the heat (it will continue to cook on the plate until served)</li>
    </ol>
